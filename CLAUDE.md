# CLAUDE.md

Claude-specific router. Mirrors `AGENTS.md` for the routing table and adds the Claude-only Skills / Plan-mode / Worktree protocol below. When you change either router, update the other.

## What this is

`gmgn-twitter-intel`: a single Python service that ingests GMGN's anonymous public WebSocket, extracts Twitter-mentioned crypto entities, scores them, and serves results over HTTP / WebSocket / CLI to a small React frontend. One PostgreSQL store. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

The pipeline is Kappa/CQRS: PostgreSQL material facts (`events`,
`token_intents`, `token_intent_resolutions`, `asset_identity_*`,
`market_ticks`, `enriched_events`) are the only business truth. Derived read models
(`token_radar_rows`, `pulse_candidates`, ...) each have exactly one
runtime writer and are rebuildable. `NOTIFY` is a wake hint; every
listener re-reads DB and runs a bounded `interval_seconds` catch-up.
Provider raw frames are inputs, not facts.

## Runtime config for real data

Live-data runs use the operator-owned files in `~/.gmgn-twitter-intel/`:
`config.yaml` for application/provider/credential/storage settings and
`workers.yaml` for worker runtime knobs. Do not assume repository fixtures,
example YAML, or `.env` files are the active runtime config. Before debugging
provider data, Token Radar rows, asset profiles, or missing icons against real
data, run `uv run gmgn-twitter-intel config` and confirm the reported
`config_path` / `workers_config_path` point at `~/.gmgn-twitter-intel/`.
Never print or copy secret values; report only redacted booleans, paths, and
diagnostic command results.

## Claude-only protocol

When the `superpowers:` skills are available, use them in this order:

1. `brainstorming` — clarify intent before writing any spec.
2. `writing-plans` — produce the spec / plan; iterate with the user.
3. `using-git-worktrees` — set up `.worktrees/<slug>/` once the plan is approved.
4. `test-driven-development` — write the failing test before each implementation slice.
5. `executing-plans` or `subagent-driven-development` — drive the plan to completion.
6. `verification-before-completion` — run the verification commands and capture output.
7. `requesting-code-review` — surface the diff and the verification artefact for review.
8. `finishing-a-development-branch` — decide on merge / PR / cleanup.

Process skills take priority over implementation skills when both could apply.

CLI surface: `uv run gmgn-twitter-intel --help` is the source of truth (snapshot at `docs/generated/cli-help.md`).
